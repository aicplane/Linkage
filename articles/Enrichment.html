<p>Linkage can help you visualize tabular and graphical pathway
enrichment results of interested gene lists.
The <code><a href="../reference/GOEnrichment.html">GOEnrichment()</a></code> and
<code><a href="../reference/KEGGEnrichment.html">KEGGEnrichment()</a></code> functions allow you to input a list of
interested genes and set four key parameters (i.e., adjusted pvalue
cutoff, qvalue cutoff, minimal size of annotated genes for testing, and
maximal size of annotated genes for testing) for GO or KEGG pathway
enrichment analysis.</p>
