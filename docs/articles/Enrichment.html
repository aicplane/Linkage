<p>Pathway Enrichment Module Pathway Enrichment Module supports users to
visualize tabular and graphical pathway enrichment results of interested
gene lists, which can be produced from previous analysis of Linkage. The
enrichment analysis can link these gene lists with underlying molecular
pathways and functional categories such as gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).</p>
